# ITS250-Project-1
A Python project created for ITS 250 at Campbell University by Kaitlyn Keesee and Malia McKay. Both students worked together to write this code.

This program is used to calculate if the user's SAT score is at the required level for acceptance at Campbell University, 
North Carolina State University, and University of North Carolina.

The user inputs their individual scores in the math and reading/writing section of the SAT and the program then totals the score to 
calculate if the user's SAT score falls in the range of each school. 

The program then prints to the user which schools their score is in  range for or if they need to improve their score for each school.
